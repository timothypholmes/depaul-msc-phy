Quiz 2


1.What concepts or ideas from this reading do you have questions about? These can be concepts that you didn't understand or would like to learn more about. For each concept, write a few sentences that describe the concept as best you can and include your questions about the concept.

At the end of the chapter we are introduced to the time average of a function. Why do we assume that the sum of P_alpha * r_alpha remains finite and why would the denominator go to infinity? 

2.What is the significance of a cyclic coordinate in the Lagrangian? Why would a Lagrangian have a cyclic coordinate, and what is the consequence of such a coordinate? Explain this both conceptually and mathematically.

Based on the books definition, a particular coordinate that does not appear in the Lagrangian is called cyclic or ignorable. If the coordinate qi is cyclic then the system will not  depend on qi bringing no change to the system. Therefore, the derivative with respect to the coordinate will always be zero. If we look at the Lagrangian, the partial derivative with respect to qi will go away from this. The consequence is that we don't know what the coordinate would be but we do know the system is conserved. 

3.Throughout this section Hamill uses notation like 𝜕𝑓/𝜕𝒓% where 𝑓 is a scalar and 𝒓% is a vector.What does this notation mean? Give an example to illustrate your answer.

f returns whatever that function is at qi=qi, qi dot=qi dot, and at time t=t (frozen in time). So the function gives one output, which is expected. We also have N particles added to the displacement of the same infinitesimal distance. What we are actually finding is a solution for any vector on this surface.
