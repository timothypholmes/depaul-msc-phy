This is the home directory for the Tiny server, a 200-line Web server that we
use in "15-213: Intro to Computer Systems" at Carnegie Mellon University and
"CSC 374/CSC 407: Systems II" at DePaul University.  Tiny uses the GET method to
serve static content (text, HTML, GIF, and JPG files) out of ./ and to serve
dynamic content by running CGI programs out of ./cgi-bin. The default page is
home.html (rather than index.html) so that we can view the contents of the
directory from a browser.

Tiny is prethreaded and supports POST requests.

Tiny is neither secure nor complete, but it gives students an
idea of how a real Web server works. Use for instructional purposes only.

To run Tiny:
   Run "tiny <port>" on the server machine, 
	e.g., "tiny 8000".
   Point your browser at Tiny: 
	static content: http://<host>:8000
	dynamic content: http://<host>:8000/cgi-bin/adder?1&2
