This is the handout directory for the CS:APP Cache Lab. 

************************
Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:
    $ make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    $ ./test-csim

Check the correctness and performance of your aoat functions:
    $ ./test-aoat -N 32
    $ ./test-aoat -N 64
    $ ./test-aoat -N 67

Check everything at once (this is the program that your instructor runs):
    $ ./driver.py
