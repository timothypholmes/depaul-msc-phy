% The cite package cleans up the way citations are handled.  For example, it
% changes the citation [1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11] into [1-3,6-11].  If your advisor
% wants superscript citations, use the overcite package instead of the cite package.

% The url package allows for the nice typesetting of URLs.  Since URLs are often
% long with no spaces, they mess up line wrapping.  The command \url{http://www.physics.byu.edu}
% allows LaTeX to break the url across lines at appropriate places: e.g. http://www.physics.byu.edu

% The hyperref package provides automatic linking and bookmarking for the table

%
% To include a link in your pdf use \href{URL}{Text to be displayed}.  If your

% above.
%
% To add a bookmark in the pdf you can use \pdfbookmark.  You can look up its usage
% in the hyperref package documentation

\Dedication{
    This thesis is dedicated to my father for supporting and encouraging my interest in science from the beginning. I would not have come this far without his hard work and love. \\
    
    \vspace{8mm}
    
    I am indebted to the staff and scientists at Fermilab and Matthew Wetstein for boosting my scientific curiosity. Eric Landahl for making the pattern recognition measurements possible, and for providing me with an unparalleled scientific environment to grow in. Finally, Ellek Linton for sharing Machine Learning expertise and a pint off the coast in California.
